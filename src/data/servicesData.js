          "Ants are social insects that live in colonies, which can range from a few dozen individuals to millions. Understanding their behavior and nesting habits can be key to effective control. Ants build their nests in various places, including soil, under rocks, inside walls, and even in trees. Ants often send out scouts to find food sources. Once a scout finds food, they release pheromones to guide others to the source, creating a trail. This foraging behavior explains why infestations can seem to appear suddenly as more ants follow established paths. Ant activity often increases in the spring and summer months. During these times, queens will establish new colonies, and workers will forage for food to sustain the colony. Ant colonies are structured, social insect communities typically consisting of a queen (or multiple queens), numerous sterile female workers, and seasonally winged males and females.",
          "Ants feed on sugars, syrups, honey, fruit juice, fats, and meat which they find in human habitation. Ants can cause contamination hazards by their presence on the production floor, raw materials, and finished goods store.",

          "Ants in the house or outside, especially in lines: Seeing ants scuttling around on the floor or in the kitchen is a clear sign of an infestation. Ants marching in lines or trails are also a strong indicator that they've found a food source or a nesting site.",
          "Ant nests and pathways: Ant nests can appear as small piles of dirt or soil, particularly around entry points. Some ants might nest in walls or other hidden areas, so look for signs of soft spots, crumbling edges, or wood that gives way under pressure.",
          "Discarded Wings: 'Swarmer' carpenter ants are likely to leave behind discarded wings near window sills, baseboards, or vents. Carpenter ants also create small holes in wood as they excavate their nests.",
          "Pheromone trails: Ants use pheromones to communicate and create trails leading to food or nesting sites. These trails are not visible pathways, but rather invisible chemical signals.",
          "Dirt Mounds: Near Your Home. Ant hills are mounds of soil or dirt that ants create as entrances to their underground nests. If the dirt is in the form of a mound, this is an indication of an ant nest. Look in the dark corners of your office or damp, moist places.",
          "Improper Storage: Ants may be attracted to spills or improperly stored food items. Unsealed food containers, spills, and crumbs on surfaces or in crevices can attract ants, so proper food storage and cleaning are crucial to prevent infestations.",

They also need water to survive and are attracted to moisture from leaky pipes, standing water, or damp areas. Finally, they seek dark, warm, and hidden places for shelter, such as cracks, crevices, and clutter. Cockroaches pose various health risks, including disease transmission, triggering allergies, and exacerbating respiratory conditions like asthma. They can carry bacteria like Salmonella and E.coli, which can contaminate food and lead to infections.",

The American Cockroaches prefer warm, laundry washing areas, boiler rooms, humid environments, such as basements and sewers.

Eye exposure to this fluid can lead to more severe reactions like conjunctivitis. When threatened, millipedes release a fluid from glands along their bodies. Millipedes are nocturnal and prefer to live in damp places. A female millipede can lay up to 300 eggs in the soil, which hatch within a few weeks. Millipedes go through 7-8 life cycle stages from birth to adult. A millipede infestation is often indicated by seeing these pests in your home, especially in damp and dark areas like basements, crawl spaces, and garages. You might also find them near decaying material like firewood or compost piles. Other signs include damage to paper, cardboard, or other wood-based materials, as well as the presence of their shed exoskeletons or small, dark droppings. Centipedes can bite and inject venom. While their venom can cause pain and swelling, some individuals may experience more severe reactions, especially if they have allergies or are bitten by larger species. A centipede infestation is indicated by frequent sightings, especially at night, in damp areas of your home like basements or bathrooms. Other signs include finding shed skins, droppings resembling tiny black or brown pellets, and an increase in other pest populations that centipedes prey on.",

Lizards are commonly found in buildings that are surrounded by vegetation including trees and dense plant growth. They do not live or infest in indoor areas, but come in from surrounding vegetation. These pests have the potential to contaminate food products and thus their control is essential. The lizards can carry and potentially transmit diseases to humans.

However, the outbreaks of termites can be seen in every season, but in the rainy season, it is the fastest spread. Along with windows, doors, and wood items, it spreads on paper too soon. According to the study, more than 1,500 castes of termites have been traced so far. In India, the termite of 230 different species is found. It is believed that termites have been on earth for the past 20-30 million years and have been found in many mythologies and epics. A heavy termite infestation can cause severe damage to wooden structures. They can weaken wooden floors and beams, making them prone to collapse. This can lead to accidents and injuries to the people in the house. Also, termites can chew on electrical cables while trying to access softwood. Termites are social insects with four main castes: workers, soldiers, reproductives (king and queen), and immature termites. Workers and soldiers are sterile, while reproductives are responsible for colony establishment and reproduction.",
